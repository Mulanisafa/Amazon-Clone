## Overview

This project is an Amazon Clone where I recreated the home page of Amazon.com to look exactly like the real website. The key difference is that it features only futuristic products for shopping, while maintaining the same look and feel as the original site.

## Features

- **Identical Design:** The home page replicates the design of Amazon.com exactly, ensuring a familiar user experience.
- **Futuristic Products:** Only futuristic products are featured, showcasing advanced and innovative items.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS3:** For styling the web page to match Amazon's look and feel.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mulanisafa/Amazon-Clone.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Amazon-Clone
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

- Navigate to the home page to see the recreated Amazon website with futuristic products.
- Browse through the different sections to see various futuristic items for shopping.
- The page is fully interactive and mimics the behavior of the actual Amazon home page.
